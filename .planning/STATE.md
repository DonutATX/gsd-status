# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-05-20)

**Core value:** A developer running GSD in a project can glance at VS Code and immediately know: which milestone, which phase, and what just happened — without leaving the editor.
**Current focus:** Phase 4 — tooltip, commands + configuration

## Current Position

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Init]: Always-visible status bar with "No GSD project" fallback — discoverability
- [Init]: TypeScript + VS Code Extension API, no bundler, no runtime deps
- [Init]: Hand-rolled regex line scanner for ROADMAP.md / STATE.md parsing
- [Init]: Use vscode.RelativePattern for FileSystemWatcher (avoids Windows backslash bug)
- [Phase ?]: [01-02]: Inline parseLite in extension.ts (Phase 2 will replace wholesale)
- [Phase ?]: [01-02]: Sync activate() with fire-and-forget updateStatusBar — never block host

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- STATE.md exact grammar for "latest entry" — needs real STATE.md file review before writing state-parser.ts (Phase 2)

## Deferred Items

| Category | Item | Status | Deferred At |
|----------|------|--------|-------------|
| Marketplace | Publisher account, GitHub Actions publish workflow, listing assets | v2 | Init |
